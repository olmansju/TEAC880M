# TEAC880M

This repository supports educators, instructional designers, and data scientists in the creation of designs and prototypes of learning analytics tools and technology-supported assessments and evaluations. Using these resources, weâ€™ll explore the history of assessment and evaluation, the rise and current state of learning analytics tools, and the potential for all of them to make new insights and better learning possible within and beyond K12 settings. Learn new theories, experiment with new tools.
